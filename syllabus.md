<a id="books"></a>

### Textbooks and required purchases: 

- *Lecture Tutorials for Introductory Astronomy*, 3rd Edition, by Prather, Slater, and Brissenden.

	- This is a small book containing exercises that we will work through in class. It is absolutely essential (more important than the textbook, even!); we will spend a lot of time in class on these tutorials, which give you an opportunity to flex your astronomical-reasoning muscles as you learn the course content. Many of the exam questions will relate directly to the tutorials in this book.

- *The Essential Cosmic Perspective*, 7th edition or any other recent edition, by Bennett et al.

	* This is the main textbook for the course, containing most of the course content. We will follow the book somewhat closely, and there will be suggested readings before each course meeting.

### Course philosophy 

#### 1. Reasoning and synthesis, not memorization

This course is emphatically not a class where you will come to lecture, sit there and listen to a presentation of some facts, and then repeat them back to me on exams. Rather, you wil need to think about how we’ve gained the understanding that we have about our universe, and engage in scientific reasoning based on astronomical principles. You are not going to be learning a list of currently-accepted facts; you are going to be practicing skills and learning to see the universe as scientists see it.

#### 2. Astronomy as a liberal art

Most people’s interest in astronomy begins as children, when they look up at the night sky and say “Wow, that’s gorgeous; I want to know more about that!” Or, perhaps, they watch *Star Trek* or *Battlestar Galactica* and want to know more about the universe outside our world that inspired the storytellers. The ancients’ interest in astronomy began with more pragmatic goals in mind: the night sky can be used to navigate. We’ve been to the moon, we’ve sent robots to the planets, and two lonely spacecraft are floating out to the stars, keeping in fading contact with us for the time being using the dwindling power from their plutonium-powered transmitters. Perhaps, someday, we will follow them? Regardless of the reason, astronomy has captured the imagination of humanity like no other science, and we would be amiss in our study of astronomy not to look at the broader influence that the heavens have had on the larger sweep of human imagination and thought.

Most of you won’t become astrophysicists; you will become designers and businessfolk, architects and reporters, doctors and lawyers, and writers and thinkers, and I hope that you will take some of the inspiration, the poetry, the philosophy, the wisdom, and the wonder of astronomy into your chosen disciplines and your lives.

#### 3. This is your class, too

As part of this philosophy, I welcome your input. If there is some aspect of astronomy that inspires or fascinates you, please ask; if you have feedback for me that will help you enjoy the class more, then please let me know.

### Course Material

This course focuses mostly on the astronomy of the solar system, and is divided into four sections:

*1.* **What we can see from Earth:** the stars, the moon, and the sun, how the night sky changes, and why it looks the way it does

*2.* **Celestial motion:** why the planets move in the ways that they do, and the laws of gravity and orbits

*3.* **The nature of light:** what light is, how it tells us about the Universe, and how it affects the heavens

*4.* **Humans and the Universe:** the past, present, and future of spaceflight, and the possibility of life elsewhere

### Course Activities 

#### Readings


Reading the text is an essential part of this astronomy class! I encourage you to read the assigned sections on the [calendar](./calendar.html) ahead of time, as that way the presentation of the material in class will serve as reinforcement and enrichment rather than be the first time you see something. 

#### Class Meetings

In the auditorium, we will alternate between presentation and practice. I will first introduce you to the new ideas we are studying, asking questions and getting your answers using colored cards. (These take the place of clickers.) If you have done the reading ahead of class, these presentations will serve as review and enrichment. Questions during the presentation are encouraged and welcome! After the presentation, we will work through the **Lecture Tutorials.** These are activities designed for you to complete in small groups of 2-4; we will allot time in lecture for you to work through them and ask us questions as you proceed. This sort of practice – thinking on your own – will be absolutely necessary for you to do well on the exams, and much of the exam material will be drawn from the tutorials. If you are not sure about the solutions to the tutorials, please ask me during the help sessions (office hours), or talk to your classmates.

####Classroom Etiquette

 Please...

* ... arrange to come to class on time and stay until the end; the slamming of the auditorium doors is very annoying to your classmates

* ... do not throw vegetables or fruit at Professor Freeman, except for grapefruit and apples, which he fancies 

* ... do not catch Pidgeys in class

* ... do not use your cellphones for anything else, either


#### Homework

You will have assigned homework using the Mastering Astronomy online system, at <http://www.masteringastronomy.com>. You should have a student access code if you bought the package at the bookstore; if you didn’t, you will need to purchase an access code from the website. Further instructions for setting up Mastering Astronomy will be given in the first week of class. Late homework will not be accepted; thus, if you are having technical difficulties accessing the software, please make sure you sort these out well in advance of the deadline. To complete a homework assignment, you need to answer each question and then click submit.Then you need to submit each part of the homework. Once you have submitted all parts, you should see the message You completed this assignment when you view the assignment. If you have questions, see me in office hours before the assignment is due. There will also be periodic written homework that you will submit to your lab TA’s.


#### Labs

AST101 satisfies the laboratory course requirement of the liberal arts core and so it has a compulsory lab component. Many important course activities take place in the laboratories, and so attendance at the lab sections is required. This is also a take-home lab that you complete by making observations of the Sun over a period of several weeks. Anyone missing four or more labs (including the take-home lab) will receive a grade of zero for the lab portion of the course! There are NO make-up labs, so if you do not attend a lab or you fail to return your work for grading, you will receive a zero for that lab and it will count as a
missed lab. A small course fee is charged which helps pay for (i) handouts which are distributed to you; (ii) computers, supplies, small pieces of apparatus, and maintenance for the laboratory and 4observatory; (iii) supplies and apparatus for lecture exercises and demonstrations; and (iv) maintenance of the telescopes used for observing sessions.

Many of the laboratory exercises require a laptop computer to complete. We will provide a loaner laptop to each group in the laboratory, but you are also encouraged to bring your own laptop, if you wish. Laptops can also be borrowed from the library for no cost. It is imperative that you attend the laboratory meeting as scheduled in the syllabus. If you are unable to attend your assigned lab, you may contact your TA in advance and ask if you can attend a different lab session that week. Management of temporary switches is at the discretion of the TAs. If your lab conflicts with a regular class or other appointment, see Patty Whitmore to inquire about switching lab sections. If you temporarily attend another lab section or switch to another lab, you are responsible for ensuring that the TAs have correctly recorded your lab scores. The names and email addresses of the TAs are posted on the door of the lab rooms.

One lab during the semester is a take-home lab which you will complete in your own time, making observations of the Sun over several weeks. This will be introduced in class.

#### Help Sessions

These help sessions are opportunities for you to interact with me and the rest of the teaching team in small groups or individually. (Some folks call them "office hours".) If you have questions or suggestions, need help with your homework or with studying, or just want to chat, this is a great opportunity. They will be held in the Physics Clinic, room 112.

### Grading and Exams 


| Item       |            Date           | Points           |
|------------|:-------------------------:|-----------------:|
| Homework   | Due Fri at start of class |              25  |
| Exam 1     |         Wed Oct 5         |              25  |
| Exam 2     |                           |              25  |
| Exam 3     |         Wed Nov 2         |              25  |
| Final Exam |   Time and Location TBD   |              50  |
| Labs       |   Throughout the semester | 25               |

The lowest of your exam grades and the homework grades will be dropped. (That is, I will drop your lowest exam grade, unless your homework grade is lower than any of them, in which case I will drop it.)

####Homework 

No late homework will be accepted since it is graded electronically, but I will drop the lowest of your homework grades.

####Exams

There will be three exams and a final on the dates shown on the course schedule. These exams will involve multiple choice questions, and may involve free-response questions as well. No makeup exams will ordinarily be given. Students who must miss an exam due to University-sanctioned travel or unavoidable emergencies must inform me as soon as possible; they may take a makeup oral exam or may drop the missed exam as their lowest exam grade. There are no opportunities to make up the final exam, although in extenuating circumstances I may offer an oral final exam (for
instance: emergent hospitalization).

Exam questions will be drawn from lectures, the text, the homework, and (to a significant degree) the lecture tutorials. You will need to bring only pencils to your exam. If you believe your exam has not been graded correctly, fill out a Regrade Request form within two weeks of the exam date and give it to me during office hours. If you require accommodations for your exam, please contact me in advance so I can arrange for you to get the assistance you need.

####Labs

Labs will be graded on a five point scale:

• 0: Nothing, or nothing relevant
• 1: A minimal attempt, or severe errors
• 2: The assignment is partially complete or contains multiple major errors
• 3: The assignment is complete, but contains errors in the solutions
• 4: The assignment is complete, but may contain several minor errors
• 5: The assignment is complete and correct.

**Important: Your grade for the course may be no higher than one letter grade higher than your grade for the lab component.** Thus, if you fail the lab, you cannot get higher than a D for the course. Your lowest lab grade will be dropped.

### Academic integrity

While you are encouraged to discuss your homework with your peers, all work you submit must reflect your own understanding. You are not allowed to communicate with or collaborate with anyone other than teaching staff during exams. Consulting a cellphone for any reason during an exam without permission will be considered presumptive evidence of
academic dishonesty.

Syracuse University's academic integrity policy reflects the high value that we, as a university community, place on honesty in academic work. The policy defines our expectations for academic honesty and holds students accountable for the integrity of all work they submit. Students should understand that it is their responsibility to learn about course-specific expectations, as well as about university-wide academic integrity expectations. The university policy governs appropriate citation and use of sources, the integrity of work submitted in exams and assignments, and the veracity of signatures on attendance sheets and other verification of participation in class activities. The policy also prohibits students from submitting the same written work in more than one class without receiving written authorization in advance from both instructors. The presumptive penalty for a first instance of academic dishonesty by an undergraduate student is course failure, accompanied by a transcript notation indicating that the failure resulted from a violation of academic integrity policy. The presumptive penalty for a first instance of academic dishonesty by a graduate student is suspension or expulsion. SU students are required to read an online summary of the university's academic integrity expectations and provide an electronic signature agreeing to abide by them twice a year during pre-term check-in on MySlice. For more information and the
complete policy, see http://academicintegrity.syr.edu/.

### Students with disabilities

If you believe that you need accommodations for a disability, please contact the Office of Disability Services (ODS), http://disabilityservices.syr.edu, located in Room 309 of 8047 University Avenue, or call (315) 443-4498, TDD: (315) 443-1371 for an appointment to discuss your needs and the process for requesting accommodations. ODS is responsible for coordinating disability-related accommodations and will issue students with documented Disabilities Accommodation Authorization Letters, as appropriate. Since accommodations may require early planning and generally are not provided retroactively, please contact ODS as soon as possible.

More generally, if there is anything I can do to help you, whether it is related to a disability, a medical condition, or anything else, please let me know. I have an excellent working relationship with ODS and will do anything in my power to make your experience in my class a good one.

### Religious observances 

*(The following is common to all SU classes)*

SU’s religious observances notification and policy, found at http://hendricks.syr.edu/spiritual-life/index.html, recognizes the diversity of faiths represented among the campus community and protects the rights of students, faculty, and staff to observe religious holidays according to their tradition. Under the policy, students are provided an opportunity to make up any examination, study, or work requirements that may be missed due to a religious observance provided they notify their instructors before the end of the second week of classes. An online notification process is available for students in My Slice / StudentServices / Enrollment / MyReligiousObservances / Add a Notification.

*(The following is specific to AST101)*

Events of equal solemnity to major religious observances, occurring on inflexible dates, will be given the same deference as religious observances. This includes weddings and commitment ceremonies of immediate family members, funerals, caregiving duties for sick family members, and the like. If you need to miss class for such a reason, please notify Dr. Freeman as far in advance as practical to discuss arrangements.
