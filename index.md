<h1> Welcome to Physics 307!</h1>

### 28 September agenda

* Discuss animation
* Finish working on Project 3
* Discuss what you should do over the weekend:
  * Read the notes on <a href="notes/anim.html">animation</a>
  * Read the notes on <a href="notes/DE-notes.pdf">differential equation solvers</a>
  * Read the notes on <a href="notes/symplectic.html">symplectic solvers</a>

### 26 September agenda

* Do a retrospective of Project 2
* Summarize the high points of what you read for homework over the weekend
* Get started on Project 3
* New notes: on <a href="notes/DE-notes.pdf">differential equation solvers</a> and <a href="notes/anim.html">making animations</a>.

### 21 September assignment

Please read the <a href="notes/DE-notes.pdf">notes on differential equations</a>
before Tuesday's class. You might also be interested in a draft of
<a href="projects/hw3.pdf">Project 3</a>; it will be revised before Tuesday,
but this is the gist.

### 12 September agenda:

* Do a retrospective of Project 1 and see how far you all are
* Talk about numerical integration methods and introduce Project 2
* Introduce the idea of power-law scaling and log/log plots
* Introduce functions in C

New notes:

* <a href="notes/function.c">Functions in C</a>
* <a href="integration-notes.pdf">Analysis of integration methods</a>

### 7 September agenda:

* talk about conditionals (if/then/else) and a few odds and ends you need to 
do next week's homework
* talk about how we're going to grade Project 0
* work on Project 1

New notes: make sure you look at [the sample programs](notes/samples.html).

### 5 September agenda:

* talk about models of computing in this class (using your own laptop, different operating systems, and so on)
* make sure everyone is able to do the basic tasks of Project 0: write and run code, graph data, send code to us, 
and so on. <b>Project 0 is due at the end of class, just as a checkpoint for this.</b>
* make sure that people who want to use their own laptops, whether Linux, Mac, or Windows, have the tools to do that (see [the notes](notes/laptop.html))


### 1 September agenda:

* discuss what computational physics is about
* go over some basic C commands, involving doing basic math
* discuss how to plot functions
* get started on Project 0!

**Notes that might be helpful:**

* [Intro to Linux](notes/linux.html), section 3: input and output redirection
* [Intro to Linux](notes/linux.html), section 4: graphing functions
* [Intro to C](notes/c.html), sections 2 and 3: math and loops


### 30 August agenda:
* discuss the unusual way I am grading you this semester (see <a href="sbg.html">the rubric</a> and the syllabus)
* introduce you to the folks teaching this class
* ensure everyone can log into the course computer
* introduce some basic Linux commands and the C programming language
* guide everyone through writing their first C program!
