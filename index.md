<h1> Welcome to Physics 307!</h1>

### 20 October agenda:

* Work on Project 5
* Discuss command line parameters

The sample code I wrote in class demonstrating them is available at 
<a href="pendulum.c">pendulum.c</a>. 

Notes 

### 18 October agenda:

* Have a quiz
* Talk about orbits in which the Sun isn't fixed at the origin
* Start HW5

### Sample leapfrog code for pendulum

Here it is: <a href="pendulum.c">pendulum.c</a>

To download this onto the course computer, you may type `curl -O http://walterfreeman.github.io/phys307/pendulum.c`; this will download
it into the current directory.

### 11 October agenda:

* Discuss the concept of symplectic integrators
* Talk about a sample solution to HW3; see my code at <a href="pend-multiple.c">pend-multiple.c</a>
* Work on HW4

### 6 October agenda:

* Discuss the phenomenology of the swinging pendulum in Project 3
* Discuss the stability of the pendulum
* Introduce how to simulate orbits

### 4 October agenda:

We will focus today on working on Project 3... and have a quiz, as promised.

### 15 September agenda:

We will discuss:

* log-log plots
* Taylor series analysis of the midpoint and trapezoid rules
* Two more minor coding issues relating to roundoff error

Then we will work on your projects... and have a quiz. :)

### 8 September agenda:

* work on projects all day
* hand out copies of the Taylor series inventory

### 6 September agenda:

* finish up project 0
* start on project 1
* discuss a few new programming things:
   * conditionals: "if this, do that"
   * a bit more advanced math
* answer your questions!

### 1 September agenda:

* go over some basic C commands, involving doing basic math
* discuss how to plot functions
* get started on Project 0!

**Notes that might be helpful:**

* [Intro to Linux](notes/linux.html), section 3: input and output redirection
* [Intro to Linux](notes/linux.html), section 4: graphing functions
* [Intro to C](notes/c.html), sections 2 and 3: math and loops


### 30 August agenda:
* discuss what computational physics is about
* introduce you to the folks teaching this class
* ensure everyone can log into the course computer
* introduce some basic Linux commands and the C programming language
* guide everyone through writing their first C program!
