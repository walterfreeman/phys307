<h1> Welcome to Physics 307!</h1>

### Take-home quiz

Please complete <a href="taylor-series-inventory.pdf">the Taylor series inventory</a> by next Tuesday and bring it to class.
This will 
be graded for completion, but not accuracy; anyone turning anything in (even if you don't know any of the answers)
will get full credit. You should take this at home without referencing the internet or your notes/books; 
remember, the goal is not to get all the answers right, but to give me information about what you know and don't know.


### 8 September agenda:

* work on projects all day
* hand out copies of the Taylor series inventory

### 6 September agenda:

* finish up project 0
* start on project 1
* discuss a few new programming things:
   * conditionals: "if this, do that"
   * a bit more advanced math
* answer your questions!

### 1 September agenda:

* go over some basic C commands, involving doing basic math
* discuss how to plot functions
* get started on Project 0!

**Notes that might be helpful:**

* [Intro to Linux](notes/linux.html), section 3: input and output redirection
* [Intro to Linux](notes/linux.html), section 4: graphing functions
* [Intro to C](notes/c.html), sections 2 and 3: math and loops


### 30 August agenda:
* discuss what computational physics is about
* introduce you to the folks teaching this class
* ensure everyone can log into the course computer
* introduce some basic Linux commands and the C programming language
* guide everyone through writing their first C program!
