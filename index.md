New notes:

* <a href="notes/function.c">Functions in C</a>
* <a href="integration-notes.pdf">Analysis of integration methods</a>

### 6 September agenda:

* talk about conditionals (if/then/else) and a few odds and ends you need to 
do next week's homework

New notes: make sure you look at [the sample programs](notes/samples.html).

**Notes that might be helpful:**

* [Intro to Linux](notes/linux.html), section 3: input and output redirection
* [Intro to Linux](notes/linux.html), section 4: graphing functions
* [Intro to C](notes/c.html), sections 2 and 3: math and loops


### 30 August agenda:
* talk briefly about what this class will be, and what you can expect
  * I gave a talk on [SU's Physics 307 class](aaptsummer2018.pdf) at the American Association of Physics Teachers conference this summer; here are the slides 
if anyone'd like to read them.
* introduce you to the folks teaching this class
* ensure everyone can log into the course computer
* introduce some basic Linux commands and the C programming language
* guide everyone through writing their first C program!
