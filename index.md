<h1> Welcome to Physics 307!</h1>

### 29 August agenda:
* introduce you to the C programming language
* introduce you to a few other programming ideas in both Python and C
* demonstrate the ideas behind computational physics and the power of the discipline
* turn you loose on Project 0



### 27 August agenda:
* talk briefly about what this class will be, and what you can expect
  * I gave a talk on [SU's Physics 307 class](aaptsummer2018.pdf) at the American Association of Physics Teachers conference last summer; here are the slides 
if anyone'd like to read them to get an idea of what this class will be like.
* introduce you to the folks teaching this class
* ensure everyone can log into the course computer
* introduce some basic Linux commands and the C and/or Python programming languages
* guide everyone through writing their first program!

In more detail, here are the instructions for the first day:

* First decide if you want to use your own laptop or our computers for the course:
  * If you have a Linux or Mac laptop, then you should probably use it right away for everything
* Join the Slack channel at [suphysics.slack.com](https://suphysics.slack.com) and send memes/say hi
* Get started writing code in C, Python, or both:
  * You can find notes about both C and Python on the [notes](notes/) page, along with a comparison of the two. I'll also demonstrate
    both.
* If you have time, experiment with plotting things. I'll demonstrate this if we have time.
