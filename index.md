<h1> Welcome to Physics 307!</h1>

### 6 October agenda:

* Discuss the phenomenology of the swinging pendulum in Project 3
* Discuss the stability of the pendulum
* Introduce how to simulate orbits

### 4 October agenda:

We will focus today on working on Project 3... and have a quiz, as promised.

### 15 September agenda:

We will discuss:

* log-log plots
* Taylor series analysis of the midpoint and trapezoid rules
* Two more minor coding issues relating to roundoff error

Then we will work on your projects... and have a quiz. :)

* discuss a few new programming things:
   * conditionals: "if this, do that"
   * a bit more advanced math
* answer your questions!

### 1 September agenda:

* go over some basic C commands, involving doing basic math
* discuss how to plot functions
* get started on Project 0!
