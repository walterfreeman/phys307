<h1> Welcome to Physics 307!</h1>
### 27 August agenda:
* talk briefly about what this class will be, and what you can expect
  * I gave a talk on [SU's Physics 307 class](aaptsummer2018.pdf) at the American Association of Physics Teachers conference last summer; here are the slides 
if anyone'd like to read them to get an idea of what this class will be like.
* introduce you to the folks teaching this class
* ensure everyone can log into the course computer
* introduce some basic Linux commands and the C and/or Python programming languages
* guide everyone through writing their first program!
