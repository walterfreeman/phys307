<center><h1>How to use your own laptop for Physics 307</h1></center>

If you are able, I recommend that you use your own laptop (which you're more 
comfortable with) for this class. You can do this in two different ways:

### If you have a Linux laptop

You'll need to install the ```gnuplot``` package (run ```sudo apt install 
gnuplot``` on Ubuntu and Debian), then grab a copy of ```plot``` from the 
course computer. You can copy it into your system directory
by running ```sudo scp username@phy-compphysclass.syr.edu:/usr/bin/plot /usr/bin/``` and entering your admin password on your computer. (A little later
you'll need to get our animation utility as well.)

### If you have a Mac

You'll need to install the ```gnuplot``` package (can some Mac person 
tell the rest of us how to do that?) then grab a copy of ```plot``` from the 
course computer. You can copy it into your system directory
by running ```sudo scp username@phy-compphysclass.syr.edu:/usr/bin/plot /usr/local/bin/``` and entering your admin password on your computer. (A little later
you'll need to get our animation utility as well.)

### If you have a Windows machine

Since Windows doesn't support most scientific 
software, you'll need to connect to the
course computer from your own laptop. See the notes file on "Connecting to
the course computer". If you want to be a professional scientist, you will
probably want access to a Linux or Mac computer of your own, but installing
Linux alongside Windows on your own computer is easy. We can help you do that;
come talk to one of us.
