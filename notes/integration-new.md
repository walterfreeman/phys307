Because of my computer problems, for now, please use the notes from last year, available <a href="http://suphysics307.wikispaces.com/file/view/integration-notes.pdf/559507409/integration-notes.pdf">here</a>. 


For your homework, you’ll be doing error analysis in the simplest way possible. I’ve asked you to integrate
a function that you can integrate with pen and paper, so to determine the dependence of the error $E+1$ on the
stepsize $h$ all you need to do is to compute (numeric answer - analytic answer) for each value of $h$.
The Taylor series business is a way to predict what these errors will be before you test them, and to determine
how good an algorithm will be. You don’t necessarily need to reproduce this, but you should understand it.
