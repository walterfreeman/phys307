<center><h1>A first introduction to Python</h1></center>

<h3 id="1-basics">1. Basics</h3>

<p>Python is a newer programming language that is designed to be flexible and accessible.
It is much slower than C, but modern computers are so fast that this doesn’t matter much
for many of the things that you will do. Python is good at manipulating text,
which is difficult in C; thus, Python is commonly used by scientists to do data analysis.</p>

<p>You can run Python code in two different ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Type <code class="highlighter-rouge">python</code> at the command line, then type Python code directly into the terminal. The
computer will execute each line as you input it. (This environment is called a “REPL”, for
“Read, Evaluate, Print Loop”).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Create a text file containing Python code. Conventionally, these files have names ending in <code class="highlighter-rouge">.py</code>, for instance
<code class="highlighter-rouge">program.py</code>. You then run them by saying <code class="highlighter-rouge">python program.py</code> at the command line.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a very simple but complete Python program that you can try:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="k">print</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Hello, world!"</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="2-math-and-variables">2. Math and variables</h3>

<p>Here’s a slightly more complicated program that introduces how to do math in Python:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">numpy</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="o">*</span>

<span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">float</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">input</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Enter a number: "</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">float</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">input</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Enter another number: "</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="n">c</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">sqrt</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="o">**</span><span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="o">**</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">print</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"The hypotenuse of a triangle with legs of length"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s">"and"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s">"is"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">c</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>There are some new things here.</p>

<p>Line 1 imports functions from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">numpy</code> module. One of the great strengths of Python is the enormous
range of modules available for it that do different things. NumPy, short for <em>numerical Python</em>, is a set
of mathematics functions. We will need it in order to have access to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">sqrt</code> function which we’ll use later.</p>

<p>Line 3 sets the variable <code class="highlighter-rouge">a</code> equal to a number that the user enters. The function <code class="highlighter-rouge">input()</code> reads some text from the keyboard.
So writing <code class="highlighter-rouge">a = input("Enter a number: ")</code> prompts the user to type something, and then stores whatever the user types
in the variable <code class="highlighter-rouge">a</code>.</p>

<p>So, what’s this <code class="highlighter-rouge">float</code> business?</p>

<p>Variables and other objects in Python can have many different types. A variable like <code class="highlighter-rouge">a</code> can represent an integer, a decimal number 
(called <code class="highlighter-rouge">float</code>, for “floating-point”, i.e. scientific notation), some text (called a “string”), a list of numbers or strings of text, or even more 
complicated things.</p>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">input()</code> function returns a string – that is, text. Note that there is a difference between <em>the number 5.0</em> and <em>a string of text comprised of
the characters “5.0”</em>. Specifically, the computer knows how to do mathematics with numbers, but doesn’t know how to do math with text – even if that
text describes a number. So, in order to do math with the things we have read from the keyboard, we must
convert them into numbers. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">float()</code> function converts text into floating-point (i.e. decimal) numbers, which does exactly 
what we want here.</p>

<p>So line 3:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Prompts the user to enter a number</li>
  <li>Converts whatever they type to a value of type <em>float</em></li>
  <li>Stores that value in the variable <code class="highlighter-rouge">a</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Important</strong>: The <code class="highlighter-rouge">=</code> operator in Python is called the <em>assignment</em> operator. It does not mean that one thing must forever be equal to another thing.
Instead, it does something much more mundane: it takes the value on the right-hand side of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">=</code> and stores it in the variable on the left-hand
side of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">=</code>. Thus, statements like <code class="highlighter-rouge">x = x + 1</code> are perfectly valid Python: this just means “make x bigger by 1”.</p>

<p>Line 4 does the same thing for another number, storing it in <code class="highlighter-rouge">b</code>.</p>

<p>Line 5 does some mathematics. Notice that <code class="highlighter-rouge">**</code> is the exponentiation operator, so <code class="highlighter-rouge">a**2</code> means $a^2$, not <code class="highlighter-rouge">a^2</code>. Remember line 1, where we 
imported the <code class="highlighter-rouge">numpy</code> module? The <code class="highlighter-rouge">sqrt</code> function lives inside it, which we use now.</p>

<p>Finally, line 7 prints out the result. Notice that you can easily mix text and numbers in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">print()</code> function.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="3-loops-repeating-things-multiple-times">3. Loops: repeating things multiple times</h3>

<p>Here’s another program that introduces looping structures: commands that tell the computer
to repeat chunks of code. <strong>Clever use of these is the key to programming:</strong> the whole
point of using a computer is that it can do repetitive, tiresome mathematical tasks quickly.</p>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">for</code> statement tells the computer to repeat a block of code multiple times. Python has a 
special type of object called an <em>iterable</em>, which you can think of as “an instruction for how
to repeat something”.</p>

<p>For now, we need one iterable, which is the <code class="highlighter-rouge">range</code> function. It generates a range of numbers;
<code class="highlighter-rouge">range(5)</code> generates the set of numbers <code class="highlighter-rouge">(0, 1, 2, 3, 4)</code>.</p>

<p>See if you can guess what this program does before you run it:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">print</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s">"squared is"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">print</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"All done!"</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Then run this code, and see how it works!</p>

<p>Notice a few things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>There is a colon after the <code class="highlighter-rouge">for</code> statement. Statements like <code class="highlighter-rouge">for</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">if</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">while</code> are called <em>control statements</em>.
They tell the computer how to repeat, or whether to run, a block of code that follows them. In Python, they end with a colon.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The block of code to be repeated is <em>indented</em>. Indentation in Python is used to describe blocks of code, and Python will
complain if you don’t indent every line in a block of code by the same amount. Tabs and spaces are <em>not</em> the same: just because
two things look like they’re indented the same amount, if one uses tabs and another uses spaces, Python will complain.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s another way to do the same thing:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
<span class="k">while</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">print</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s">"squared is"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="k">print</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"All done!"</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>You may end a loop prematurely using <code class="highlighter-rouge">break</code>.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="4-conditional-statements">4. Conditional statements</h3>

<p>Here’s one more program that illustrates how to use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">if</code> statement to make the computer do one thing or another.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="c"># use the int() function to change text to integer</span>
<span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">int</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">input</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Enter an integer: "</span><span class="p">))</span>  

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">print</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"The number is positive"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">print</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"The number is negative"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">print</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"The number is zero"</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>A couple of new things here. The biggest one is the <code class="highlighter-rouge">if</code> statement, of course. Note the
use of <code class="highlighter-rouge">==</code> rather than <code class="highlighter-rouge">=</code> to check for equality. Single-equals is the assignment operator that
changes the value of a variable; double-equals tests to see if two things are equal. Mixing
these up is a common mistake.</p>

<p>Also notice the text beginning with <code class="highlighter-rouge">#</code>. This is a comment: text that is completely
ignored by the compiler and does nothing, but is included just as a note to anyone reading
the code. Use comments liberally; it’s essential that you or someone else reading your code
can figure out what it does. At a minimum, any program you submit should have a comment
at the top telling who wrote it and what it does.</p>
