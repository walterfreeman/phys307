<center><h1>Notes on organizing your files</h1></center>

<p>You should take some time to organize your files into directories. I’d like you to create directories named “project1” or “hw1”, etc., for your various projects, and take five minutes to sort your files into them.</p>

<p>You can do this in one of two ways. The <em>graphical approach</em> is probably going to be more familiar to those of you with experience on Mac or Windows computers. Run <code class="highlighter-rouge">nautilus</code> to create a graphical file manager. Note that this a graphical program running remotely, and might 
run a bit slowly if your internet connection is not solid. You can use this just as you use the Windows file manager.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can use the Linux command line to do this. The first concept to understand is the Linux directory naming structure.</p>

<p>On a Linux system, files are stored in a <em>hierarchical directory tree</em>. The base of the tree is the <em>root directory</em>, named <code class="highlighter-rouge">/</code>. Inside <code class="highlighter-rouge">/</code> are many system directories with names like <code class="highlighter-rouge">/bin/</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">/boot/</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">/usr/</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">/etc/</code>, and so on. The one we care about is <code class="highlighter-rouge">/home/</code>, which in turn contains a directory for each user on the system. For instance, my home directory is <code class="highlighter-rouge">/home/wafreema/</code>. You can always abbreviate your home directory as <code class="highlighter-rouge">~</code>. Two other shorthands are <code class="highlighter-rouge">.</code> for the current directory and <code class="highlighter-rouge">..</code> for the parent of the current directory.</p>

<p>When referring to a directory, you can either specify an <em>absolute pathname</em>, starting with a <code class="highlighter-rouge">/</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">~</code>, or a <em>relative pathname</em>, which is relative to the current directory. So, for instance, when you type <code class="highlighter-rouge">./integrate_midpoint</code>, you are asking the computer to run the program <code class="highlighter-rouge">integrate_midpoint</code> in the current directory.</p>

<p>The commands you will need are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">mkdir</code> <em>foo</em> – make a directory called <em>foo</em> inside the current directory.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">cd</code> <em>foo</em> – change to directory <em>foo</em> if one exists in the current directory. You may stack multiple directories: for instance, <code class="highlighter-rouge">cd hw1/graphs</code> will change to the directory <code class="highlighter-rouge">graphs</code> inside the directory <code class="highlighter-rouge">hw1</code>. Entering <code class="highlighter-rouge">cd ../hw2</code> will change to the directory <code class="highlighter-rouge">hw2</code> contained within the directory one level up from the current one. Entering something like <code class="highlighter-rouge">cd ~/hw4</code> will change into the directory <code class="highlighter-rouge">hw4</code> inside your home directory. Finally, <code class="highlighter-rouge">cd</code> by itself will go back to your home directory.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">mv</code> <em>files</em> <em>destination</em> will move a bunch of files.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">cp</code> <em>files</em> <em>destination</em> will copy a bunch of files.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">rm</code>  <em>files</em> will delete a bunch of files.</li>
</ul>

<p>How do you specify multiple files at once? You may use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">*</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">?</code> characters, called “wildcards” or “globs”. <code class="highlighter-rouge">*</code> matches any number of characters. So, for instance, writing <code class="highlighter-rouge">mv hw3*.c project3</code> will move all files beginning with <code class="highlighter-rouge">hw3</code> and ending in <code class="highlighter-rouge">.c</code> to the directory <code class="highlighter-rouge">project3</code>. You may also use this to list only certain files, by typing <code class="highlighter-rouge">ls *.c</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">ls project?/*.c</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Prashant has asked that you compress your projects into a single archive before turning them in</strong>. To do this, type <code class="highlighter-rouge">zip archive.zip [files] </code>. For instance, if you have all your stuff for homework 3 in a directory called <code class="highlighter-rouge">project3</code>, you can change to that directory and type <code class="highlighter-rouge">zip project3.zip *</code> to add all those files to the archive <code class="highlighter-rouge">project3.zip</code> and send it to Prashant. Remember to add a <code class="highlighter-rouge">README</code> file telling him what all the files are for.</p>
