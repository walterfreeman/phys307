<center><h1>How to use your own laptop for Physics 307</h1></center>

<p>If you are able, I recommend that you use your own laptop (which you’re more 
comfortable with) for this class. You can do this in two different ways:</p>

<h3 id="if-you-have-a-linux-laptop">If you have a Linux laptop</h3>

<p>You’ll need to install the <code class="highlighter-rouge">gnuplot</code> package (run <code class="highlighter-rouge">sudo apt install 
gnuplot</code> on Ubuntu and Debian), then grab a copy of <code class="highlighter-rouge">plot</code> from the 
course computer. You can copy it into your system directory
by running <code class="highlighter-rouge">sudo scp username@phy-compphysclass.syr.edu:/usr/bin/plot /usr/bin/</code> and entering your admin password on your computer. (A little later
you’ll need to get our animation utility as well.)</p>

<p>You can also download <code class="highlighter-rouge">plot</code> <a href="plot">here</a>; once you download it, copy it into your /usr/bin directory with <code class="highlighter-rouge">sudo cp plot /usr/bin/</code>.</p>

<p>Since you will be working locally, you won’t be connecting to the course computer for anything. This means that you won’t have to do anything difficult to 
submit your work (since it’ll be saved on your own computer), but <strong>if you ask me for help, you’ll need to attach your code (.c file)</strong> since I otherwise
won’t be able to log into the course computer and see it.</p>

<h3 id="if-you-have-a-mac">If you have a Mac</h3>

<p>You’ll need to install the <code class="highlighter-rouge">gnuplot</code> package first. To do this, according to Prashant Mishra:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go to http://brew.sh and install brew first in your laptop. 
Brew is a package manager for macOS that allows you to easily install software from the terminal.</li>
</ol>

<p>First, you’ll want to install xquartz, which will give you nice graphical output from gnuplot. To do this, type <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew cask install xquartz</code>.</p>

<p>Then in the terminal just type <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew install gnuplot --with-x11</code>. 
And you are done. In fact you can use brew in future for any package installation. Just type in the terminal <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew install &lt;packagename&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Then, grab a copy of <code class="highlighter-rouge">plot</code> from the 
course computer. You can copy it into your system directory
by running <code class="highlighter-rouge">sudo scp username@phy-compphysclass.syr.edu:/usr/bin/plot /usr/local/bin/</code> and entering your admin password on your computer. (A little later
you’ll need to get our animation utility as well.)</p>

<p>If plot doesn’t work out of the box, you’ll want to install a perl interpreter, which presumably can be done with <code class="highlighter-rouge">brew install perl</code>.</p>

<p>You can also download <code class="highlighter-rouge">plot</code> <a href="plot">here</a>; once you download it, copy it into your /usr/local/bin directory with <code class="highlighter-rouge">sudo cp plot /usr/local/bin/</code>.</p>

<p>Since you will be working locally, you won’t be connecting to the course computer for anything. This means that you won’t have to do anything difficult to 
submit your work (since it’ll be saved on your own computer), but <strong>if you ask me for help, you’ll need to attach your code (.c file)</strong> since I otherwise
won’t be able to log into the course computer and see it.</p>

<h3 id="if-you-have-a-windows-machine">If you have a Windows machine</h3>

<p>Since Windows doesn’t support most scientific 
software, you’ll need to connect to the
course computer from your own laptop. See the notes file on “Connecting to
the course computer”.</p>

<p>If you want to be a professional scientist, you will
probably want access to a Linux or Mac computer of your own, but installing
Linux alongside Windows on your own computer is easy. We can help you do that;
come talk to one of us!</p>
