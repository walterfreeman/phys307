Remember, to submit your assignment, email to <suphysics307@gmail.com>. Include all your code (`.c` files), your graph (the PDF of your plot), and your report.
This report will be short (since in the beginning we're mostly interested in developing some computer skills, rather than doing physics), but the reports will
be a larger and larger portion of your submission as the semester goes on.

1. Use a text editor to create a file with the following information, and send it in an email to suphysics307@gmail.com
with the following information:

    - Your name, NetID, major, and academic year
    - Do you have any programming experience? If so, in which languages?
    - Are you interested in using your own laptop for this class? If you are, which of the following are you interested in doing:
      - Using a Mac and running everything on your own computer
      - Using a Windows machine to connect to the course computer, like we do with the lab machines
      - Running a Linux system inside a "virtual machine" on your Windows box
      - Installing Linux on your own laptop 
    - What physics classes have you taken/are you taking now?
    - What math classes have you taken/are you taking? (Do not list calculus classes if you are beyond the calculus sequence.
    - Are there any physical systems you are interested in modeling in this course?

   Try to do this tonight or Wednesday, so I can see the results by Thursday's class.

2. Write a C program that reads in a temperature in Celsius and prints the equivalent in Fahrenheit.
Discuss any issues that arose in writing your code. (Even if there weren't any, include a note saying so.
All of your programs should be submitted with some accompanying discussion.)

3. Write a C program that prints two columns of numbers, corresponding to x and $\sin x$ over some
interesting range. Save the output to a file. Then modify your program to generate values for another
function of your choice over that range. Finally, use the `plot` tool to generate a PDF of a graph 
containing both functions, and submit your graph.

4. Think of a way to test (roughly) how many arithmetic operations your computer (either the course
computer, or your own) can perform per second. Note that printing things to the screen is a far bigger
task for the computer than adding or multiplying, so don't slow the computer down by requesting lots
of output. There are hard ways to do this -- and one very simple one. Choose the simple one!
Discuss how your code measures this and how accurate you think your measurement is.
Can you think of any factors that might cause you to get a lower result than you might otherwise?
You should keep this value in your head throughout the semester as an order-of-magnitude estimate
for how long calculations will take.

5. Join the [suphysics.slack.com](Slack team for Syracuse Physics). Say hi -- introduce yourself, be silly, and ask questions! This is one of the best places for you to get help with your code, from your classmates or from me.
