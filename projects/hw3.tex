\begin{enumerate}
\item{

First we will study a DE that we can solve analytically so we can compute error as a function of stepsize.

Newton's law of cooling says that the rate of temperature loss is proportional to the temperature difference between the cooling object and the ambient temperature $T_a$; that is,

\begin{equation}
\PAR{T}{t} = -k(T-T_a)
\end{equation}

where $k$ is a proportionality constant that depends on the materials involved and their surface area. The analytic solution to this DE is

\begin{equation}
T(t) = T_a + (T(0) - T_a)e^{-kt}
\end{equation}
  
Consider a cooling cup of tea. When the water is removed from the heat, it is at $100^\circ$. Suppose that room temperature is $30^\circ$, and that $k=0.1 {\rm {min}}^{-1}$.

\begin{enumerate}

\item{Write a program that solves the differential equation above for the temperature $T$ as a function of time using Euler's method. Plot this function vs. time for stepsizes $dt$ of 1 minute, 10 seconds, and 1 second, along
with the analytic solution. Does your numeric solution do a good job of capturing the behavior of the system?}

\item{Now, investigate the error in a rigorous way. Compute the temperature after five minutes for a range of stepsizes $dt$, and make a log-log plot of the error vs. the stepsize. Is the scaling what you expect it to be?}

Note: You should actually solve the DE numerically using Euler's method; the exact solution given above is just so you can compute the error. This is the second-to-last thing we will study in this class that has an easy, obvious analytic solution!

\end{enumerate}
}

\item{Repeat the preceding problem with the second-order Runge-Kutta method.}

\item{Now, using RK2, answer the question ``How long does it take the tea to cool to $T_f=70^\circ$?'' Make a plot of the error in your result vs. stepsize and verify that you're seeing second-order scaling. 
Note that in order to achieve second-order accuracy, you will need to correct for ``overshoot'', as we will discuss in class. 

Briefly, if you discover that the temperature is $T_1$ (greater than 70 degrees) at $t_1$, and $T_2$ (less than 70 degrees) at $t_2$, in order to achieve second-order precision you need to interpolate to figure out what time you actually hit 70 degrees at. That time is given by

\begin{equation}
t_1 + \frac{t_1-t_2}{T_1-T_2} (T_1-T_f)
\end{equation}

or alternatively

\begin{equation}
t_1 + \left(\left.\PAR{T}{t}\right|_{t_1}\right)^{-1} (T_1-T_f)
\end{equation}

(I find the second more intuitive and easier to apply, since you already have been calculating $\PAR{T}{t}$ many times already.)

}

\item{Now we will solve a DE that we can't do with pen and paper. The equation of motion for a pendulum is

\begin{equation}
\PARTWO{\theta}{t}=-\frac{g}{L} \sin \theta
\end{equation}

In mechanics class you solved this by taking the small-angle approximation $\sin \theta \approx \theta$; the equation then has a solution

\begin{equation}
\theta(t) = A \sin (\omega t + \phi)
\end{equation}

where $\omega=\sqrt\frac{g}{L}$ giving a period $T=2\pi\sqrt\frac{L}{g}$. This is valid only in the limit $\theta \rightarrow 0$.

This equation is very difficult to solve without making this approximation using pen and paper, but you have a computer! 

\begin{enumerate}

\item{Without making the small-angle approximation, 
write a computer program that solves Newton's law (rotational form) to compute the oscillation of a swinging pendulum using the RK2 algorithm. (It may be helpful to code Euler as a first step.)}

\item{Animate your pendulum using {\tt anim}.}

\item{Modify your program to determine the period of the pendulum and print it out. You can determine when a period has elapsed by looking for sign changes in $\omega$.}

\item{Suppose a pendulum clock keeps accurate time when $\theta_{\rm max}=5^\circ$. How many seconds will it gain or lose per day if it is swinging at an angle of  $\theta_{\rm max}=20^\circ$?}

\item{Now, make a plot of the fractional deviation in the period, defined as $\Delta = \frac{T-T_0}{T_0}$. Here $T_0$ is the small-angle-limiting period, $T_0=2\pi\sqrt\frac{L}{g}$. Calculate this for a range of $\theta_{\rm max}$ from $10^{-5}$ to 2 (radians). Make a log-log plot of $\Delta$ vs. $\theta_{\rm max}$.
Based on what you know about the power series expansion of $\sin(x)$, comment on its appearance. Is it what you expect?}
