\item Now we will solve a DE that we can't do with pen and paper. The equation of motion for a pendulum is

\begin{equation}
\PARTWO{\theta}{t}=-\frac{g}{L} \sin \theta
\end{equation}

In mechanics class you solved this by taking the small-angle approximation $\sin \theta \approx \theta$; the equation then has a solution

\begin{equation}
\theta(t) = A \sin (\omega t + \phi)
\end{equation}

where $\omega=\sqrt\frac{g}{L}$ giving a period $T=2\pi\sqrt\frac{L}{g}$. This is valid only in the limit $\theta \rightarrow 0$.

This equation is very difficult to solve without making this approximation using pen and paper, but you have a computer! 


\begin{enumerate}

\item{Without making the small-angle approximation, 
write a computer program that solves Newton's law (rotational form) to compute the oscillation of a swinging pendulum using the RK2 algorithm. (It may be helpful to code Euler as a first step.)}

\item{Animate your pendulum using {\tt anim}.}

\item{Modify your program to track the conservation of energy. 

\item{Modify your program to determine the period of the pendulum and print it out. You can determine when a period has elapsed by looking for sign changes in $\omega$.}

\item{Suppose a pendulum clock keeps accurate time when $\theta_{\rm max}=5^\circ$. How many seconds will it gain or lose per day if it is swinging at an angle of  $\theta_{\rm max}=20^\circ$?}

\item{Now, make a plot of the fractional deviation in the period, defined as $\Delta = \frac{T-T_0}{T_0}$. Here $T_0$ is the small-angle-limiting period, $T_0=2\pi\sqrt\frac{L}{g}$. Calculate this for a range of $\theta_{\rm max}$ from $10^{-5}$ to 2 (radians). Make a log-log plot of $\Delta$ vs. $\theta_{\rm max}$.
Based on what you know about the power series expansion of $\sin(x)$, comment on its appearance. Is it what you expect?}

%%\item{{\bf Graduate students and ambitious undergraduates:} Looking at the animation from the previous, you'll notice that the pendulum still oscillates essentially
%%sinusoidally, but with a frequency that now depends on the amplitude. 
%%
%%This information still doesn't let us get an exact solution to the differential 
%%equation
%%
%%$$\ddot \theta = -k^2 \sin \theta$$
%%
%%where $k^2 = \sqrt{g/L}$ for simplicity.
%%
%%However, for small amplitude, we can obtain an approximate solution using
%%perturbation theory. You can do this by expanding everything out to 
%%next-to-next-to-leading-order (written NNLO) in power series in $\theta$
%%-- both the DE and your guess for its solution.
%%
%%This means that the differential equation becomes
%%
%%$$\ddot \theta = -k^2 \left( \theta - \frac{1}{6}\theta \right).$$
%
%What about its solution? You might guess that it's still sinusoidal (which you
%can write as a complex exponential for simplicity), but now the frequency
%is also a power series in the amplitude $A$. 
%
%and your guess at its solution can be written
%
%$$\theta(t) = A \exp{\left[i\left(\omega_0 + A \omega_1 + A^2 \omega_2\right)t\right]}$$
%
%Here $\omega_0$ is the low-amplitude limiting frequency, and $\omega_1$
%and $\omega_2$ are amplitude-dependent corrections. The approach we will 
%take here is {\it classical perturbation theory}, a more generalized form of
%what you learned in your quantum mechanics class.
%
%You can proceed as follows:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Differentiate $\theta(t)$ to get $\ddot \theta$
%\item Substitute the resulting expression back into the differential equation, 
%
