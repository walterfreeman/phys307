  <li>
    <p>Use a text editor to create a file with the following information, and send it in an email to suphysics307@gmail.com
with the following information:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Your name, NetID, major, and academic year</li>
      <li>Do you have any programming experience? If so, in which languages?</li>
      <li>Have you used a Unix-like operating system before? If so, which one?</li>
      <li>What physics classes have you taken/are you taking?</li>
      <li>What math classes have you taken/are you taking? (Do not list calculus classes if you are beyond the calculus sequence.</li>
      <li>Are there any physical systems you are interested in modeling in this course?</li>
      <li>What are your thoughts on the “objective-based grading” approach I am taking for this course?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Write a C program that reads in a temperature in Celsius and prints the equivalent in Fahrenheit.
Discuss any issues that arose in writing your code. (Even if there weren’t any, include a note saying so.
All of your programs should be submitted with some accompanying discussion.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Write a C program that prints two columns of numbers, corresponding to x and $\sin x$ over some
interesting range. Save the output to a file. Then modify your program to generate values for another
function of your choice over that range. Finally, use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">plot</code> tool to generate a PDF of a graph 
containing both functions, and submit your graph.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Think of a way to test (roughly) how many arithmetic operations your computer (either the course
computer, or your own) can perform per second. Note that printing things to the screen is a far bigger
task for the computer than adding or multiplying, so don’t slow the computer down by requesting lots
of output. Discuss how your code measures this and how accurate you think your measurement is.
Can you think of any factors that might cause you to get a lower result than you might otherwise?
You should keep this value in your head throughout the semester as an order-of-magnitude estimate
for how long calculations will take.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(Graduate students) Think of a problem you encountered in your first-year classes that you could possibly solve using numerical
calculations, and by doing so gain some kind of physical insight that either extends or complements the insight you got from
attacking that problem analytically. Describe that problem and how you approached it analytically, and then explain why you think
numerical study of that problem might be illuminating.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
