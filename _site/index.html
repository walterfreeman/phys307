<center> Tuesday and Thursday, 11:00-12:20, Physics Building 115 </center>

<hr />

<h4 id="instructors">Instructors:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Dr. Walter Freeman, lead instructor: wafreema@syr.edu, office Physics Building 215</li>
  <li>Prashant Mishra, prmishra@syr.edu, graduate teaching assistant and grader</li>
  <li>
    <p>Patrick Miles, pmiles@syr.edu, and Aaron Hutchins, athutchi@syr.edu, undergraduate learning assistants</p>
  </li>
  <li>Email address for homework submissions: suphysics307@gmail.com (shared with instructional staff)</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4 id="asking-for-help">Asking for help</h4>

<p>You are encouraged to email the teaching staff with questions that arise outside of class; you will often get a prompt response. I encourage you to 
cc: the learning assistants on your emails; whichever of us sees your email first will answer. Patrick and Aaron took this class last year, 
so they are quite familiar with the material.
Please put [Phys307] in the subject line, so mail filters will flag your email as important.</p>

<p>I encourage you to ask us to help
you debug your programs once you’ve made an effort to figure it out yourself; while learning to debug code
is important, I don’t want you to waste six hours trying to track down a missing minus sign or curly brace.
We are here to help you! As a general rule, if your program isn’t compiling, email us after five to ten minutes of trying to figure out
what is wrong; if there is a bug of another sort, email us after fifteen to thirty minutes of trying to figure it out on your own.</p>

<p>We will be covering a great deal of ground in this course, so if you don’t understand something or fall behind,
ask for help; that’s what I am for. Learning computational physics often involves a lot of personal coaching
and messy practice – it is more like learning to play the guitar than learning geography. (We will learn something about
guitars in our class, in fact!)</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="office-hours">Office hours</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Tuesdays, 4:30-6:30, and Fridays, 9:30-11:30, and others to be added</li>
  <li>I’m also often around – feel free to email me and set up an appointment at other times</li>
  <li>Help session will be announced, and may be changed <em>ad hoc</em> to accommodate homework deadlines
or your preference.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4 id="course-overview">Course overview:</h4>

<p>This course is an introduction to the art of using computers to aid in solving problems in physics and other
sciences. You will learn the basics of programming a computer to do computations and physical simulations,
as well as the equally important skill of interpreting the results that the computer gives. In this course we
will teach you to use the C programming language on a Linux system, but what you learn here will apply to
many other languages and architectures. In fact, any of you who know another serious programming language are
welcome to use it instead of C in my class; this list includes Fortran, Python, Java, Perl, and probably some others
that I haven’t heard of.</p>

<p>First we’ll study the basics required to get around a Linux environment and learn some simple C programming. 
Then we will learn how to use those skills to accomplish some
mathematical tasks, e.g. integrating functions. As part of our study of numerical integration, we will develop the tools
required to answer questions like “How well can I trust a numerical calculation?” and “On what things does the numerical result depend?”
We will then apply these skills to model various physical situations, picking up new programming and computational skills along the way. One of
the most important is knowing how to interpret results from the computer, and when to suspect that your
simulation isn’t accurately reproducing what you want it to reproduce.</p>

<p>While we will study computer programming and the Linux environment, and these things are important
aspects of this course, these are only tools; /the emphasis in this course will always be on the computational
aspect/, even though you will spend a lot of time programming. However, the C-on-Linux environment we will be using is the gold standard for scientific computing. 
The tools you will learn in my class are the same tools used to program ten-thousand-processor 
supercomputers, and you can transfer these skills to other environments and languages (such as Python) if that’s what you use in your research.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="course-philosophy">Course philosophy:</h4>

<p>This class is going to be a significant amount of work; I have high standards for what I want you to accomplish. However,
you have a team of four people on your side to help you. This class is emphatically not a class in which you attend lecture, learn things, go home and work by yourself,
and submit a fully-formed clean result. Computational physics, and especially the process of learning it, is
messy. You should ask questions – early and often. The teaching staff and I will all be happy to answer
your questions in class. Help session hours are a good time to work on your projects, when folks am around to answer
your questions.</p>

<p>Also, I want to make sure you all know that my door is always (figuratively) open to help you with whatever other issues arise this semester.
If you need help in another class or if you just have a question about physics in general, please
ask me. I am a teaching professor, so it is my full-time job to help students!</p>

<h4 id="computing-environment">Computing environment:</h4>

<p>As you might expect, you will be using computers quite extensively in my class. There is a course computer
running Linux which you can access via <code class="highlighter-rouge">ssh</code> to phy-compphysclass.syr.edu. You are welcome to use the
machines in the classroom to do this at any time, or you may connect from your personal laptops (running
any OS; you will need a few pieces of free software if you are on Windows).</p>

<p>You may also do all of your computing on your personal machines. You are welcome to bring your personal
laptops to class and use those in lieu of the machines provided. If you need any help getting things working
on your own machines, please ask.</p>

<p>Macs will be usable without much hassle, since OSX is quite similar to Linux under the hood. If you have a
Windows machine, it is generally not that difficult to set up a dual-boot Linux environment or a virtual machine; I can help you
with this, and can provide you with the graphics software installed on the course system. You are welcome
to use any other C-on-Unix environment you have access to.</p>

<p>If you have a Mac or a Linux system, you will likely get smoother graphical performance if you run things
locally, especially if you live off campus, once we start making 2D and 3D animations.</p>

<p>In general, extensions won’t be given for problems with your own hardware (“my dog ate my laptop”), but
will of course be given for problems with SU’s equipment or network.</p>

<h4 id="grading">Grading:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Projects (around ten): 70%</li>
  <li>Unannounced in-class quizzes: 10%</li>
  <li>Final exam: 20%</li>
</ul>

<p>Final grades will be assigned on the following basis:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">
A     A-    B+    B     B-    C+    C     C-    D    F
&gt;85 80-85 77-80 73-77 70-73 67-70 63-67 60-63 50-60 &lt;50
</code></p>

<p><em>Incompletes:</em> A grade of “incomplete” is a provisional grade given to any student who is unable to complete the coursework during the 
semester due to unavoidable personal problems. In general, a student is eligible for an incomplete if they are substantially unable to 
come to class or study for a period of two weeks or more, or one week in the last month of class, due to personal illness or injury, 
illness or injury in the family (including significant others), legal involvement, or international issues. Please contact me if you
feel that you might need to take an incomplete in my class, and we can discuss your options.</p>

<h4 id="projects">Projects</h4>

<p>The bulk of your grade will come from the computational projects you will complete throughout
the semester. You will have time during class to begin your projects, but you will also work on them outside
of class as homework. When you finish, email all of the code (the .c files), your report, and any auxiliary files (graphs, etc.) to
suphysics307@gmail.com so we can grade it. Please make our lives easier by putting (for instance)
“HW2” and your name in the subject line.</p>

<p>The most important part of your project is your report. The format of these reports can be somewhat
informal; most students in the past have simply typed their report in the body of an email or a plain text
file. You may also use Markdown to prepare your reports. 
The informal format should not compromise the quality or rigor of your analysis, however. They should
be clearly written, as you will be graded on the clarity of your thoughts. Note that code submitted without
a report will not be graded, even if it works perfectly.</p>

<p>In these reports, you should discuss any difficulties you encountered in your computational project, the basic
approach you took, what results you got, and why you got them. Did anything strange happen? Why do
you think it happened? You should also answer any specific questions asked in the assignment. Other than
that, we are not looking for any particular things; we expect you to use your own judgment and write about
things that you consider notable. If in doubt, the following points are often worth addressing, since they get
to the heart of computational science:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Why is my calculation/simulation designed in the way that it is?</li>
  <li>How well does my calculation/simulation approximate physics?</li>
  <li>How do I know this?</li>
  <li>Are there any circumstances where the simulation breaks down or encounters difficulty?</li>
</ul>

<p>Your grade will be based on your report; if it appears that your code is working properly, we may not even
read the code, especially later in the semester when computational issues will be more important. If something
goes wrong, of course, we will look at your code to try to figure out what happened.</p>

<p>Projects will be accepted up to 48 hours late for half credit; extensions will be given in extenuating circumstances
and will be handled on a case-by-case basis. You are more likely to get an extension on your
homework if you have made substantial progress before the deadline. If you are falling behind, <em>please ask me for help in advance</em>.
I am very willing to work with students to help them catch up, and I don’t want anyone’s grade to suffer because they got overwhelmed
by coursework and were unable to meet deadlines.</p>

<h4 id="quizzes">Quizzes:</h4>
<p>The quizzes will be short (pencil-and-paper) unannounced quizzes which should be fairly straightforward,
and should not pose a problem if you have been coming to class.</p>

<h4 id="final-exam">Final exam:</h4>
<p>The final exam will be a written final during the scheduled time period. It will not require
you to write computer code. However, it will be open-notes; you may use any notes you have taken, any code you have 
written, or any of the class reference material.</p>

<h4 id="students-with-disabilities">Students with disabilities:</h4>
<p>If you believe that you need accommodations for a disability, please contact the Office of Disability Services
(ODS), http://disabilityservices.syr.edu, located in Room 309 of 804 University Avenue, or call (315) 443-
4498 for an appointment to discuss your needs and the process for requesting accommodations. ODS is
responsible for coordinating disability-related accommodations and will issue students with documented
disabilities Accommodation Authorization Letters, as appropriate. Since accommodations may require early
planning and generally are not provided retroactively, please contact ODS as soon as possible.</p>

<p>More informally, if there is anything I can do for you, please ask me. I am around to help you, whether that
is with a disability, disruption due to illness, personal issues, or anything else. I have an excellent
working relationship with ODS, and am willing to do anything in my capability to ensure that my class is accessible
and welcoming to all.</p>

<p>The most common accommodation that students receive is extra time on exams, to include the in-class quizzes we have.
If you receive extra time on exams, please discuss your situation with me so we can arrange for you to get enough time
for the quizzes.</p>

<h4 id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity:</h4>

<p>I encourage you to work on your projects in groups, and to receive help from and offer help to your peers. You
must write your own code. I encourage you to get assistance from your peers with your work, although substituting
someone else’s understanding for your own constitutes academic dishonesty. In the event that you receive
substantial help from another student in writing your code, please acknowledge their help in the code comments.</p>

<p>However, you must write your reports independently, and everything you submit must reflect your own
understanding.</p>

<p>In-class quizzes must be completed without reference to notes. You may use the course website and anything you have 
stored on the course computer for the final exam.</p>

<p>The complete Syracuse University code of academic integrity can be found at
http://supolicies.syr.edu/ethics/acad integrity.htm.</p>

<h4 id="religious-observances">Religious observances:</h4>

<p>(The following is common to all SU classes)</p>

<p>SU’s religious observances notification and policy, found at http://hendricks.syr.edu/spiritual-life/index.html,
recognizes the diversity of faiths represented among the campus community and protects the rights of students,
faculty, and staff to observe religious holidays according to their tradition. Under the policy, students are provided
an opportunity to make up any examination, study, or work requirements that may be missed due to a religious
observance provided they notify their instructors before the end of the second week of classes.
An online notification process is available for students in My Slice / StudentServices /
Enrollment / MyReligiousObservances / Add a Notification.</p>

<p>(The following is specific to this class)</p>

<p>Events of equal solemnity to major religious observances, occurring on inflexible dates, will be given the same deference as religious observances.
This includes weddings and commitment ceremonies of immediate family members, funerals, caregiving duties for sick family members, and the like.
If you need to miss class for such a reason, please notify Dr. Freeman as far in advance as practical to discuss arrangements.</p>
