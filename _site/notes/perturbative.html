        <h3 id="these-notes-are-still-being-written-and-will-be-finished-by-thursday">These notes are still being written and will be finished by Thursday.</h3>

<p>This is the most broadly-applicable set of notes in this entire class.</p>

<p>The behavior of most phenomena in nature are <em>perturbative.</em> What does that mean? It means that their behavior, speaking very broadly, can be expressed in terms of a power series, where the expansion variable in the power series has something to do with an amplitude, an interaction strength, and so on.</p>

<p>In many cases, we are in the regime where that amplitude or interaction strength is small. For instance, consider a spring. You learned in your introductory physics class that it obeys Hooke’s law, $F=-k\Delta x$. However, you know intuitively that this can’t be strictly true; eventually, as the force
gets larger and larger, the spring will start behaving in non-Hooke’s-law ways, since as $F \rightarrow \infty$, you know the spring must snap and the force goes to zero. In general, we can write</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">F_{\rm spring} = k \Delta x + k_2 (\Delta x)^2 + k_3 (\Delta x)^3 + ...</script>

<p>where I have absorbed the $n!$ components of the Taylor series into the definitions of the $k’s$.</p>

<p>This lets us divide the behavior of the spring into, roughly, three regions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$\Delta x$ very small: spring behaves as given by Hooke’s law. No deviations are measurable. The subsequent terms in the Taylor series are not large enough to matter. Let’s call this the <em>ideal regime</em>.</li>
  <li>$\Delta x$ somewhat larger: Higher-order terms become important. Deviations from Hooke’s law are measurable, but the spring’s behavior is still well approximated by the first few terms in the power series. This is the <em>pertubative regime</em>, and what this set of notes is about.</li>
  <li>$\Delta x$ large: The spring behaves in drastically non-Hookian ways. Perhaps it snaps, or the metal is grossly deformed. This is the <em>nonperturbative regime</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Many, many, <em>many</em> things in nature behave this way, and the ability to classify phenomena in this way will help you immensely in your career as a scientist, engineer, or otherwise.</p>

<p>The key idea here is that in the <em>perturbative region</em>, one can classify the relevant effects as subsequent terms in the Taylor series, and think about their structure. This is important, because it gives us a handle on the behavior of things even in the nonideal region. For instance, in your swinging-pendulum
problem, you will discover that even when the period of a pendulum is measurably different from the ideal value $T_0 = 2\pi\sqrt\frac{L}{g}$, its value is <em>predictable</em>.</p>

<p>Often, we can use the Taylor series to calculate this behavior, at least to a very good approximation. This is how almost everything in quantum mechanics gets done.</p>
